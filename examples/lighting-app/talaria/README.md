# CHIP Talaria Lighting Example

An example showing the use of CHIP on the Talaria Two platform. The document will describe how
to build and run CHIP Lighting Example on Talaria Two platform. This doc is tested
on **Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (x86_64)**

## Building

-   Setup the environment by running the boostrap.sh script as menionend in the FreeRTOS_sdk_3.0_master_matter/matter/README.md **Building the Example application** secion

### Building Matter Lighting Application
The lighting application can be built in multiple modes as per the use case for Talaria TWO EVB:

- Standalone app without SSBL (Second Stage Boot Loader): For non FOTA support usecase
- Lighting application for non-secure SSBL mode: FOTA support with SSBL with non-secureboot
- Lighting application for secure SSBL mode: FOTA support with SSBL with secureboot

Common make command usage with this application:
-   To delete generated executable, libraries and object files use. Cleaning is must when you are planning tobuild application with different compile time flags:

          $ cd connectedhomeip/examples/lighting-app/talaria
          $ make clean
- FOTA will be enabled by default when building the Matter Lighting Application. To disable FOTA, build the example application with "make ENABLE_OTA_REQUESTOR=false".

#### Standalone app without SSBL
-   Build the example application to be used without SSBL:

          $ cd connectedhomeip/examples/lighting-app/talaria
          $ source third_party/connectedhomeip/scripts/activate.sh ## If not activated already
          $ make clean && make

#### Lighting application for non-secure SSBL mode
-   Build the example application to be used with non secure SSBL:

          $ cd connectedhomeip/examples/lighting-app/talaria
          $ source third_party/connectedhomeip/scripts/activate.sh ## If not activated already
          $ make clean && make EXT_FLASH=true

#### Lighting application for secure SSBL mode
-   Build the example application to be used with secure SSBL:

          $ cd connectedhomeip/examples/lighting-app/talaria
          $ source third_party/connectedhomeip/scripts/activate.sh ## If not activated already
          $ make clean && make EXT_FLASH=true SECURED=true

- Generating Facory Data steps can be referred from connectedhomeip/docs/guides/talaria/README.md #'Generating Factory Configuraion Data' section

## Commissioning and Controlling the device
- Run generated chip-tool binary using following commands. Steps to build chip-tool is provided in FreeRTOS_sdk_3.0_master_matter/matter/README.md

          $ out/debug/chip-tool interactive start
          >>> pairing ble-wifi <node-id> <wifi-ssid> <wifi-passwd> 20202021 <discriminator>
          e.g. pairing ble-wifi 1111 tplinkc6_iop InnoQA2023$ 20202021 1122
- Once the commissioning is completed successfully you can use following commands to control the D1 LED of Talaria Two EVB. Here the 1111 is the node-id given at the time of commissioning to the device
- Note: Programming T2 EVB with a factory_reset=2, removes the kvs and persisted attributes. On next factory_reset=0 boot, the light will turn on with the brightness set to default value 0. Therefore, set the brightness level first using the level control commands mentioned below, and then turn on the light.

          >>> onoff on 1111 1     ## To Turn on the LED
          >>> onoff off 1111 1     ## To Turn off the LED
          >>> onoff toggle 1111 1     ## To toggle the LED
          >>> identify read identify-type 1111 1 # To know the identify-type our case it is light output
          >>> identify write identify-time <seconds-to-blink> 1111 1 # This command is used to blink led to identify itself for <senonds-to-blink> seconds
	  >>> identify read identify-time 1111 1 # This command is used to know the seconds left to blink the led.
